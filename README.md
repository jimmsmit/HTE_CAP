# Predicting individualized treatment effects of corticosteroids in community-acquired-pneumonia: a data-driven analysis of randomized controlled trials
This repo contains the penalized logistic regression models (and corresponding used scalers, imputers and median values to split the continuous variables into dichotomized variables) which will be further validated using the data of the trials by Meduri et al.[1] and Dequin et al.[2] \n

The notebook 'Demonstration_of_final_models_and_dependencies.ipynb' shows details of the saved models and dependencies.\n\n
